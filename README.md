# S100-Schemas
S100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas uploaded as ZIP file.  See accompanying README docx file for folder organization.

The May 2019 update adds the ID attribute to the generic exchange catalogue schema. It also adds exchange catalogue schemas for S-98, S-101, S-102, S-111, and S-127.

The S-100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas <em>folder</em> in this branch is now obsolete and awaiting deletion.
