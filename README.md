# S100-Schemas
S100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas uploaded as ZIP file.  See accompanying README docx file for folder organization.

The May 2019 update adds the ID attribute to the generic exchange catalogue schema. It also adds exchange catalogue schemas for S-98, S-101, S-102, S-111, and S-127.

The S-100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas <em>folder</em> in this branch is now obsolete and awaiting deletion.

## Updated Portrayal schemas
The zip file S100_4_1_0_S100XSLTPR_20191115.zip contains the portrayal files from schemas/S100/4.0.0/S100XSLTPR/ with updates to four files implementing the changes approved at S-100 WG4 (See S-100WG4-4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 for descriptions of the updates). The other files in S100XSLTPR have not been changed in this zip but are included because some of the updated files have import or use dependencies on some of the unchanged files. The S-100 revision number for this zip has been incremented because the proposed changes are extensions to S-100 4.0.0.

## Interoperability schemas
The zip file InteroperabilitySchemasAndSample.zip contains the XML schemas and sample(s) for interoperability as described in the drafts of S-100 Part 16 and S-98. 

The exchange catalog file CATALOG.XML in the sample requires ISO schemas in order to validate, which are not included in this zip. They can be obtained from the S-100 4.0.0 schema distribution zip file on this site.
